# irtoys-2: Adding additional functions

This package is largely based on the *irtoys* package found on CRAN: [http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/irtoys/index.html](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/irtoys/index.html).

The difference lies in the **est** function.  More functionality (flexibility) is given for R to interact with bilog when estimating item parameters. Additional functionality includes:
- ability to save score and parameter files
- flexibility in input data
- adding groups
- allowing for the running of the score command
